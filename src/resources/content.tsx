        I’m a Cloud Security Architect and Automation Engineer based in Israel. Most of my work
        sits at the intersection of Microsoft security infrastructure and AI — building the agents,
        pipelines, and Zero-Trust frameworks that let security teams operate at a scale that manual
        work can’t sustain. I’ve run migrations for tens of thousands of users, built RAG systems
        that actually get used in production, and written more KQL than I’d like to admit. Outside
        of work I’m usually prototyping something in my home lab, pulling shots on my ECM Mechanika,
        or out hiking with my dog.

            Led on-prem to cloud migrations for multiple clients — moving 10,000+ users from legacy
            Active Directory to Microsoft Entra ID. Designed Conditional Access policies per tenant,
            handled the edge cases that always come up mid-migration, and documented everything
            so the client could own it afterward.
          </>,
          <>
            Owned device management across client environments: Intune MDM rollouts, compliance
            policy configuration, EDR onboarding (Defender for Endpoint), and group policy
            migration. Reduced unmanaged device exposure significantly across several accounts.
          </>,
          <>
            Built Azure automations for clients — Logic Apps workflows, HiBob-to-on-prem AD
            sync connector, user lifecycle automation. The kind of work that stops someone from
            manually running a PowerShell script every Monday morning.
          </>,
          <>
            Designed and hardened VPS environments behind Azure Application Gateway with WAF
            policies. Configured routing, TLS termination, and access control for client-facing
            workloads that needed to stay up and secure.
          </>,
          <>
            Ran KQL-based threat hunting and incident response across client Sentinel deployments.
            Handled APT and ransomware cases end-to-end — detection, containment, forensics,
            reporting. 100% SLA hit rate. Built reusable hunting queries and IR playbooks along the way.
